# SWAB

SWAB (Solitude Without A Browser) - an unblocked Google Search exploit for school Chromebooks, with a read-only file explorer. Based on my Baghdad exploit (which is similar to @Brandon421-ops's Incognito On The Sign-In Screen exploit).

## Instructions

**(1** First, sign out of your Chromebook if you haven't already.

**(2** Second, go to your WiFi settings.

**(3** Third, go to `Name servers` and set it to `Custom name servers`.

**(4** Fourth, set a minimum of one of the boxes to `52.207.185.90`. If it doesn't automatically save your modifications, disconnect and reconnect 1-3 times.

**(5** If it shows a `Network not available` page, click `Sign in as an existing user` and then the `Back` button until it shows your login page.

**(6** Under your login page, there should be a `Sign in with Google account` button. Click it, and then click `Forgot email?`.

**(7** It should now show a 400 error page. On the page, there should be a clickable Google logo. Click it.

**(7** You should now have an unblocked Google search page. If you don't, feel free to submit an issue and I will try to help.

### Please note that this isn't a browser, so you can't go back from a page once you're on it. The back button doesn't do much (I learned this also ðŸ’©).
