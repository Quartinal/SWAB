# SWAB

SWAB (Solitude Without A Browser) - an unblocked Google Search exploit for school Chromebooks, with a read-only file explorer. Based on my Baghdad exploit (which is similar to @Brandon421-ops's Incognito On The Sign-In Screen exploit).

## Instructions

(1 First, sign out of your Chromebook if you haven't already.

(2 Second, go to your WiFi settings.

(3 Third, go to `Name servers` and set it to `Custom name servers`.

(4 If it shows a `Network not available` page, click `Sign in as an existing user` and then the `Back` button until it shows your login page
