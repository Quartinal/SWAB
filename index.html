    It's February 26, 2024. Bypassi posted exactly 300 days ago about
    his discovery of LTMEAT. I haven't gotten a 
    chance to use it, though. Chess move? Nah.
    I got a chance to use it in Skiovox, and it's
    been many days since. Skiovox is ancient, and I'm
    starting to think worrisome of Bypassi. Sundar
    is likely headed to sniff like a dog, which is probably
    the right thing to do. Bypassi's desired username is already
    taken by some random guy, and don't say people don't know what
    his actual username is. It's bypassiwastaken, and Sundar
    already spent his life trying to hunt down famous Discord
    people, like Aka-But-Nice, Nebelung, and Bypassi. But, believe it
    or not, time is running down the drain for Skiovox.
